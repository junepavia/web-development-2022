Web development course

# Missy May Cabrera Notes
HTML - index.html
CSS - Javascript.css
Javascript - jsmissy.js
/-external javascript=separates HTML and code,
                     easier to read and maintain,
                     files can speed up page loads.
# Brent de Guzman Notes

JavaScript --> to program the behavior of web pages
script --> placed on bottom of body to improve display speed
getElementById() --> use to find HTML element with that Id
innerHTML --> use to modify content in html tag
document.write() --> only for testing
window.alert / alert --> to show an alert box
window.print --> print current page
semicolon --> use to seperate js statement
var,let,const --> to declaire variable
var --> use to run code in older browser
const --> general rule : always use to declare variable -> constant reference
let --> if the variable value can change
hyphen - --> not allowed in js, reserve for subtraction

 innerHTML--will return our html element as a javascript object, changes the element content
 getElementById() -- finds an HTML element
 parseINT-- states that, an int (integer) value of an HTML element whose id is firstno gets initialized to firstno. 
 console.log () ---writes a message to the console. The  console is useful for debuggin purposes.
 document.write -- creates another document, useful for testing purposes
 window.alert -- show visual alert box on the screen whatever we pass to window.alert is displayed to the user in plain text.
 A JavaScript function --- a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called". (A set of procedure/instruction)
 const -- value should not be changed.
 JavaScript counts positions from zero. 
 The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a string in a string
The lastIndexOf() method returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified text in a string:
The search() method matches a string against a regular expression 
returns the index (position) of the first match.
The match() method matches a string against  a pattern of characters
The includes() method determines whether one string may be found within another string, returning true or false as appropriate.
The startsWith() method returns true if a string begins with a specified value.
The endsWith() method returns true if a string ends with a specified value.    
Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits.
is a number without a decimal point
A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place.
JavaScript uses the + operator to concatenate the strings.
JavaScript BigInt variables are used to store big integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
A BigInt can not have decimals.
JavaScript Number Methods
   Method	 Description
toString()	Returns a number as a string
toExponential()	Returns a string, with the number rounded and written 			using exponential notation.
toFixed()	Returns a number written with a number of decimals		(rounds a number to a given number of digits.)
toPrecision()	Returns a number written with a specified length
ValueOf()	Returns a number as a number




# Erwin Rey Jumamil

innerhtml need pa ng id para ma diplays yung string or yung data
document write pag na trigger or ma use nag laod ang pag pero dsiplay na yung value naka input
window alert meron mini box lalabas sa taas

pag gumamit ng external js needed sa script mag input ng source para ma basa nya yung js mo
tapos para na triggger yung function needed mo ng button na onclcick
addinng number and string the number will treat as string
operators are use usually in condition like if switch

JavaScript Variable
var, let, const
JavaScript Operators - (+ * / -)
JavaScript Expression - (x + 1)
JavaScript Keywords are used to identify actions to be perfomed.
JavaScript Comments - (// /**/)
__________________________________________________
Variables - containers for storing data, variables declared inside a {}
Let - cannot b e redeclared, must be declared before use.
Const - cannot be reassign or redeclared
__________________________________________________
Javascript string - are written with quotes single or double (""/'')
Javascript number - can be written in with or without decimal
EL or ES numbers can be written in exponential (-e)
Boolean can only have 2 values(True or False)
__________________________________________________
Union type - describes a value that can be one of several types. We use the vertical bar ( | ) to separate each type, so number | string | boolean is the type of a value that can be a number , a string , or a boolean .
__________________________________________________
Intersection type - combines multiple types into one. This allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need. 
__________________________________________________
Type aliases - give a type a new name. 
They are similar to interfaces in that 
they can be used to name primitives and any 
other kinds that you'd have to define by hand otherwise.
__________________________________________________
Nullable types - TypeScript has two special types, null and undefined , that have the values null and undefined respectively.
__________________________________________________
Optional chaining - is defined as the ability to immediately stop running an expression if a part of it evaluates to either null or undefined 
__________________________________________________
Nullish Coalescing Operator - is an alternative to || which returns the right-side expression if the left-side is null or undefined. In contrast, || uses falsy checks, meaning an empty string or the number 0 would be considered false.
__________________________________________________
Type Assertion - Sometimes we know more about the type of a variable than the TypeScript compiler. In
those situations, we can use the as keyword to specify a different type than the one inferred by the compiler.
__________________________________________________
Never type - which indicates the values that will never occur. The never type is used when you are sure that something is never going to occur.
